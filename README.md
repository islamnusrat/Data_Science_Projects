# Data_Science_Projects
This repository contains projects on various data science concpets. Every project is grouped in its folder with the dataset and the notebook. 

### Data Wrangling
Small projects oriented to display skills for collecting and manipulating data. The folder includes practice manipulating JSON data, pulling data from a Database, and using a REST API.
  * [API & JSON](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/API/api_data_wrangling_mini_project.ipynb)
  * [SQL](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/commit/3a8259f15b9e2db7dc755e5cba93c53e74b9786c) 

### Inferential Statistics
Small projects which use statistical inference tests to determine significant differences and correlations while exploring datasets.
  * [Apps Integration Case Study](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Apps%20Integration%20Case%20Study/Springboard%20Apps%20project%20-%20Tier%203%20-%20Complete.ipynb)
  * [Frequentist Inference on Hospital Medical Charges Case Study](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Frequentist%20Case%20Study/Frequentist%20Inference%20Case%20Study%20-%20Part%20B%20(2).ipynb)

### Machine Learning
Small projects related to various standard ML algorithms. Projects invlove preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and validations needed specific for the algorithm being used in the project. Clustering, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Deep Neural Network algorithms are practiced in this section.
  * [Linear Regression on Red Wine Quality](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20Case%20Study/Springboard%20Regression%20Case%20Study%2C%20Unit%208%20-%20the%20Red%20Wine%20Dataset%20-%20Tier%203%20(1).ipynb)
  * [Logistic Regression to classify male and female using heights and weights](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Logistic_Regression_Advanced_Case_Study_updated/Logistic%20Regression%20Advanced%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
  * [Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Clustering%20Case%20Study/Clustering%20Case%20Study%20-%20Customer%20Segmentation%20with%20K-Means%20-%20Tier%203.ipynb)
  * [Grid Serach kNN ](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/GridSearch%20KNN%20Case%20Study/GridSearchKNN_Case_Study.ipynb)
  * [Decision Tree Specialty Coffee Case Study](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/RR%20Diner%20Case%20Study/Springboard%20Decision%20Tree%20Specialty%20Coffee%20Case%20Study%20-%20Tier%203%20(1).ipynb)
  * [Random Forest COVID-19 Case Study in South Korea](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/RandomForest_Covid_Case_Study/RandomForest_casestudy_covid19.ipynb)
  * [Gradient Tree Boosting on Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Gradient%20Boosting%20Case%20Study/Gradient%20Boosting%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
  * [Light Gradient Boosting Method to predict flight departures](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Bayesian%20Optimization%20Case%20Study/Bayesian_optimization_case_study.ipynb)

### Data Story
Mini Project combining exploratory data analysis and statistical inference are used to analyse a dataset and tell a story that emerges from the analysis. 
  * [Datastory - What drives our happiness](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Datastory%20What%20Drives%20our%20Happiness/DataStory_World%20happiness%20report.ipynb)

### Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis to understand evolution of sales over time. This involves visualizing data and decomposing the time series. Using the data to then forecast the future sales. 
  * [Cowboys & cigerattes case study](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Cowboys%20%26%20Cigarettes%20Case%20Study/Cowboy%20Cigarettes%20Case%20Study%20-%20Tier%203.ipynb)

### Take Home Challenge
A couple of fully worked through projects. Similar to the capstones but significantly smaller and less thorough. They are designed to be quick to read through but still display the necessary skillset of a data scientist. 
  * [Ultimate Technologies Inc Take home Challenge to predict user retention](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Ultimate%20Technologies%20Inc.%20Take-Home%20Challenge/ultimate_technologies_challenge.ipynb)
  * [Relax Inc. take home challenge](https://github.com/islamnusrat/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Relax_takehome_challenge/relax_challenge/Relax_takehome_challenge.ipynb)
